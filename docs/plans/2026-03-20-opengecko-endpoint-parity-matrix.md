# OpenGecko Endpoint Parity Matrix

> **Endpoint-level detail.** For product-level rationale, release phase framing, and non-functional requirements, see `docs/plans/2026-03-20-opengecko-coingecko-compatible-api-prd.md`. For operational status and milestone tracking, see `docs/status/implementation-tracker.md`.

This document turns the CoinGecko endpoint overview into an execution-oriented planning matrix for OpenGecko. It is meant to answer four questions per endpoint:

- how important is it for migration success
- how hard is it to implement faithfully
- what data platform components it depends on
- which release phase it should belong to

Source baseline:

- `https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/endpoint-overview`
- public reference pages linked from CoinGecko's docs index as of `2026-03-20`

This matrix is about OpenGecko planning, not a claim that OpenGecko already supports these endpoints.

## Legend

### Access tier

- `Public`: available on CoinGecko's public/demo surface
- `Premium`: paid plan only, but not enterprise-only
- `Enterprise`: enterprise-only

### OpenGecko priority

- `P0`: must-have for early migration wins and base-url replacement
- `P1`: high-value follow-up that materially expands compatibility
- `P2`: important expansion, but not required for the first strong public launch
- `P3`: advanced, premium-like, or long-tail surface with high data/platform cost

### Release phase

- `R0`: foundation and compatibility shell
- `R1`: core coins and historical charts
- `R2`: market expansion, exchanges, contract coverage, richer aggregates
- `R3`: public treasury family
- `R4`: onchain DEX and hardest premium or enterprise parity
- NFT family: removed from the active roadmap

### Internal services shorthand

- `Health`: healthcheck and metadata shell
- `CoinRegistry`: canonical coins, tokens, platforms, slugs, and address maps
- `PriceCache`: hot spot prices and quote conversions
- `MarketSummary`: market caps, volume, supply, rankings, category aggregates
- `ChartStore`: historical price, volume, OHLC, supply, and time-series storage
- `SearchIndex`: coins, exchanges, categories, and ranking logic
- `ExchangeVenue`: exchange and derivatives venue metadata plus ticker ingestion
- `TreasuryLedger`: curated entity, holdings, and transaction datasets
- `OnchainIndexer`: networks, pools, trades, token metadata, holders, and OHLCV
- `EntityResolver`: joins between CoinGecko-compatible external IDs and internal entities

## Surface Area Summary

| Family | Endpoints | Recommended first-ship focus | Main blocker |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Simple + General | 12 | Yes | search ranking and global aggregation |
| Coins + Contracts + Categories | 20 | Yes | ticker normalization and historical fidelity |
| Exchanges + Derivatives | 10 | Later | ticker normalization, trust scoring, derivatives fields |
| Public Treasury | 5 | Later | curated off-chain disclosures and derived finance fields |
| Onchain DEX | 29 | Much later | multi-chain indexing, ranking logic, holders and trader analytics |
| Total | 76 | staged rollout required | data platform complexity |

## Cross-Cutting Parity Risks

### 1. Ranking and curation are harder than routing

The hardest parity targets are not always the biggest schemas. They are often the endpoints where CoinGecko applies editorial, behavioral, or trust logic:

- `/search/trending`
- `/coins/top_gainers_losers`
- `/coins/{id}/tickers`
- `/exchanges/{id}/tickers`
- `/onchain/networks/*/trending_pools`
- `/onchain/pools/trending_search`
- `/onchain/pools/megafilter`

### 2. Historical correctness needs retained ledgers

A large share of the premium and enterprise surface cannot be recreated well from only current snapshots. OpenGecko will need retained, queryable history for:

- price, cap, and volume charts
- OHLC and OHLCV bars
- exchange volume history
- supply history
- NFT collection history
- treasury holdings history
- holder counts and address-level stats

### 3. Canonical ID mapping is a first-class system

OpenGecko needs durable internal mappings for:

- coin ids
- asset platform ids
- contract addresses
- exchange ids
- derivatives venue ids
- NFT collection ids
- onchain network and dex ids
- treasury entity ids
- category ids

Without this layer, even "easy" endpoints become unreliable.

## Recommended Build Order

### First ship: best migration value per unit effort

- `/ping`
- all `/simple/*`
- `/asset_platforms`
- `/exchange_rates`
- `/search`
- `/global`
- `/coins/list`
- `/coins/markets`
- `/coins/{id}`
- `/coins/{id}/history`
- `/coins/{id}/market_chart`
- `/coins/{id}/market_chart/range`
- `/coins/{id}/ohlc`
- `/coins/categories/list`
- `/coins/categories`
- contract-address detail and chart endpoints

### Second ship: broad market compatibility

- `/coins/{id}/tickers`
- premium coin movers and newly listed feeds
- `/token_lists/{asset_platform_id}/all.json`
- `/global/decentralized_finance_defi`
- exchange list and detail endpoints
- exchange volume history
- derivatives venue index endpoints

### Third ship: specialist verticals

- public treasury family
- derivatives detail and full ticker-heavy endpoints

### Fourth ship: GeckoTerminal parity

- entire `/onchain/*` family, starting with catalogs, pool detail, token detail, pool OHLCV, and pool trades

NFT scope is intentionally excluded from the current build order.
- only then the ranking, search, holder, and trader analytics endpoints

## Maintenance Rules

- When OpenGecko adds or drops an endpoint family, update this matrix and the PRD together.
- When an endpoint moves phase or priority, update this file before implementation starts.
- When OpenGecko intentionally diverges from CoinGecko behavior, add an explicit note to the relevant endpoint row or a follow-up compatibility note.
