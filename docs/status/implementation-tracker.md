# OpenGecko Implementation Tracker

## Purpose

This file tracks execution progress from the current repository state toward the target product defined in:

- `docs/plans/2026-03-20-opengecko-coingecko-compatible-api-prd.md`
- `docs/plans/2026-03-20-opengecko-endpoint-parity-matrix.md`

Use this tracker for current status, active priorities, completed milestones, and open blockers.

## Status Legend

- `not started`
- `in progress`
- `blocked`
- `partial`
- `done`
- `removed`

## Current Delivery Target

- Current release focus: `R4`
- Current architecture direction: `Bun + TypeScript + Fastify + Zod + SQLite + Drizzle + better-sqlite3 + SQLite FTS5 + CCXT + Vitest`
- Current repository state: `SQLite-first scaffold with CCXT + DeFiLlama + Subsquid live providers, boot-time hot-snapshot sync, continuous top-100-priority OHLCV worker, 2D freshness model, canonical chain resolution, and broad route coverage across all 76 active non-NFT endpoints. Contract surface coverage is broad. Live data coverage is approximately 55% by endpoint count — Phase 2 data fidelity uplift complete with DeFiLlama multi-network pool/token discovery, CCXT coin enrichment, and Subsquid address labels. The Graph provider was removed in 08e4b39.`

## Current Priorities

1. Restore the main Vitest suite to green so parity and milestone-sealing claims reflect actual repository state rather than planned state.
2. Finish the active `platform-and-catalog-discovery` milestone by validating bounded `/search` families, canonical-platform alias continuity across token-list/contract routes, and the remaining `/global` breadth uplifts.
3. Continue hardening the `onchain-discovery-uplift` milestone, especially deterministic invalid-params coverage and cross-network behavior after the multi-network DeFiLlama rollout.
4. Improve chart fidelity while preserving the top-100-first OHLCV policy and honest fallback behavior.
5. Tighten observability, cache invalidation, and runtime failure behavior for accepted fixture families now that derivatives, treasury, categories, onchain analytics, and supply charts are explicitly documented as fixture-backed surfaces.

## Data Quality Summary (as of 2026-03-31 Phase 2 completion)

The system has 3 live data sources: **CCXT** (8 CEX, ticker/OHLCV/exchange metadata, coin enrichment), **DeFiLlama** (multi-network pool/token discovery, price/volume/reserve), **Subsquid** (Ethereum Uniswap V3 swap logs with address labels).

| Tier | Coverage | Endpoints | Data source |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Live** (~55%) | Real-time | `/simple/price`, `/simple/token_price`, `/exchange_rates` (currency-api), `/coins/markets`, `/asset_platforms` (canonical CCXT-discovered platforms), `/exchanges` metadata, `/exchanges/{id}/tickers` (live CCXT ticker ingestion), `/onchain/networks/*/pools` (DeFiLlama multi-network discovery), `/onchain/networks/*/tokens/*` (DeFiLlama live price + decimals), `/onchain/networks/*/pools/*/trades` (Subsquid with address labels), `/coins/{id}` (CCXT-enriched description/links) | CCXT + DeFiLlama + Subsquid |
| **Hybrid** (~25%) | Partial live | `/coins/markets` sparkline (seeded 7-day synthetic candles), `/coins/{id}/history`, `/coins/{id}/market_chart`, `/coins/{id}/ohlc`, `/coins/{id}/ohlc/range`, `/global`, `/search` (seeded index + live enrichment), `/search/trending` (live market-cap rank, not true trending), `/coins/top_gainers_losers`, `/exchanges/{id}/volume_chart*` (live refresh ownership) | Mixed |
| **Fixture/Seeded** (~20%) | Zero live | `/derivatives*` (3 tickers, 2 exchanges, frozen data, `meta.fixture: true`), `/public_treasury/*` (fixture-documented responses; USD still derived from live snapshots), `/onchain/*/top_holders` (fixture USDC only), `/onchain/*/top_traders` (fixture USDC only), `/onchain/*/holders_chart` (fixture USDC only), `/onchain/pool OHLCV` (synthetic fallback), `/onchain/pool trades` (fixture fallback), `/coins/categories*` (fixture-documented), `/coins/*/circulating_supply_chart`, `/coins/*/total_supply_chart`, `/global/market_cap_chart` | 100% seeded/fixture |

**Key gap**: "Route implemented" ≠ "has live data". The 76/76 parity claim refers to HTTP contract surface (routing, parameters, response structure), not data fidelity. Several families serve seeded, fixture, or hybrid data.

## Workstream Status

| Strategic workstream | Operational scope | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-A Compatibility fidelity | Parameter precedence, error shapes, serializers, divergence tracking | partial | Route coverage is broad and the compatibility audit records 76 / 76 active non-NFT parity-matrix endpoints as implemented, but current runtime regressions mean the practical release gate is not yet satisfied |
| WS-B Live market ingestion and freshness | CCXT provider abstraction, snapshot refresh, stale-data policy, fresh-by-default reads | done | Boot-time initial sync now materializes hot snapshots and continuous 60s refresh scheduling; live data owns hot reads after sync and stale fallback remains explicit |
| WS-C Historical chart and OHLC semantics | Chart, range, OHLC, and future onchain OHLCV behavior | partial | Continuous OHLCV worker now owns restart-safe `1d` ingestion with top-100-first scheduling, recent catch-up, backward deepening, gap repair, retention enforcement, and persisted-history preference; longer-horizon operational policy remains open |
| WS-D Canonical entity resolution | Coin, platform, contract, venue, treasury, network, and DEX identity mapping | done | Canonical chain/platform resolution, alias-aware contract lookup, multi-exchange chain merging, and onchain network/platform identity mapping now cover the active compatibility surface |
| WS-E Contract testing and fixtures | Endpoint fixtures, invalid-parameter coverage, repository/service-layer assertions | partial | Coverage is broad across active families, but the main Vitest suite is currently failing in parity and runtime-sensitive areas, so this workstream should not be treated as complete |
| WS-F Jobs, operations, and observability | Refresh scheduling, search rebuilds, job failure handling, lag visibility | partial | Initial-sync failure handling, serialized runtime jobs, standalone `ohlcv:worker`, diagnostics for runtime/ohlcv/chain coverage, exchange durability hardening, and startup prewarm are in place; hosted-worker deployment guidance and deeper alerting remain open |
| WS-G Data fidelity uplift | Replace seeded/fixture data with live sources | done | Phase 2 complete: DeFiLlama multi-network pool/token discovery, CCXT coin enrichment, Subsquid address labels; Phase 3 complete: fixture documentation for derivatives, treasury, onchain analytics, categories, supply charts; live coverage increased from ~30% to ~55% |

## Endpoint Family Progress

| Family | Target phase | Status | Data quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/ping` | R0 | done | live | CoinGecko-style ping response implemented and tested |
| `/simple/*` | R0 | done | live | `/simple/supported_vs_currencies`, `/simple/price`, `/simple/token_price/{id}`, and `/exchange_rates` are implemented and tested; all backed by live CCXT snapshots or currency-api |
| `/asset_platforms` | R0 | done | live | Canonical CCXT-discovered platforms are now exposed; legacy aliases are suppressed as top-level ids |
| `/token_lists/{asset_platform_id}/all.json` | R1 | done | hybrid | Canonical platform ids remain the discovery surface, token-list rows stay deterministic/symbol-sorted, and supported aliases like `eth` still resolve downstream while unknown platforms fail closed with `404` |
| `/search` | R0 | partial | hybrid | FTS5-backed search over seeded coin/exchange tables now preserves stable grouped-family keys, rejects blank queries, and bounds each family to the top 10 results; broader relevance uplift is still pending |
| `/global` | R0 | partial | hybrid | Aggregate market routes exist and stay internally coherent with ordered market-cap chart points, but breadth uplift across the broader discovered catalog is still pending |
| `/coins/list` | R0 | done | seeded | Seeded coin registry remains in place; canonical identity propagation is improved, but true new-coin discovery is still pending |
| `/coins/list/new` | R1 | partial-live | ccxt-backed canonical discovery | Returns `coins` ordered by canonical `activated_at` from exchange discovery, collapsing duplicate exchange discoveries to the earliest activation while keeping ids reusable across list/search/detail/history surfaces |
| Core coin market endpoints | R1 | partial | hybrid | `/coins/markets` live snapshots now include canonical bootstrap backfill fixes; `/coins/{id}` now includes CCXT-enriched description/links; history/chart/OHLC fidelity work remain pending, and sparklines still rely on seeded/synthetic history |
| `/exchanges/*` | R2 | partial | hybrid | Exchange metadata and list are live from CCXT; `/exchanges/{id}/tickers` is live-backed via persisted CCXT ticker ingestion; `/exchanges/{id}/volume_chart*` is hybrid-from-live, accumulated from the same ticker refresh ownership while historical depth remains limited to retained points |
| `/derivatives/*` | R2 | partial | fixture | 3 hardcoded tickers (BTC/ETH perpetual + 1 expired), 2 exchanges; data frozen at 2026-03-20. Responses include `meta.fixture: true` and `meta.frozen_at` to signal seeded data.
| NFTs | removed | removed | — | removed from the active roadmap |
| Public treasury | R3 | done (fixture documented) | fixture | 2 entities, 6 transactions, fixed holdings. USD values still derive from live snapshots, but all treasury route payloads are explicitly marked with `meta.fixture: true`. |
| Onchain DEX | R4 | partial | live | Phase 2 complete: DeFiLlama multi-network pool/token discovery (ETH, Solana, Avalanche, Fantom), live price/decimals enrichment, Subsquid address labels for trades; `top_holders`, `top_traders`, and `holders_chart` now advertise `meta.fixture: true` for their USDC-only fixture scope; `pool OHLCV` fallback is 6 synthetic candles |

## Active Decisions

- Use SQLite for MVP and local-first self-hosting.
- Use Bun as the default package manager.
- Prefer the smallest practical dependency set.
- Use CCXT first for exchange and market integrations; only add custom exchange support when required data is missing.
- Use `binance`, `bybit`, `coinbase`, `kraken`, `okx`, `gate`, `mexc`, and `bitget` as the default active CCXT exchange set, while treating default enablement as a curated allowlist rather than "all CCXT exchanges".
- Treat CCXT-discoverable chains from the active exchange set as the baseline network universe for contract and platform compatibility mapping.
- Use a default market refresh cadence of `60s`, a search rebuild cadence of `900s`, and a live freshness threshold of `300s`.
- Treat fresh-by-default market responses as a central product value; REST reads should come from continuously updated internal snapshots.
- Treat historical OHLCV durability as a continuous worker concern: startup only needs hot snapshots, while the worker prioritizes top-100 recent catch-up before historical deepening.
- Keep the codebase as a modular monolith before considering service splits.
- Prioritize HTTP contract compatibility before data fidelity.
- Track rollout by endpoint family and release phase.
- **Seeded data serves as intentional fixtures for development, not production data**: the data quality gap is acknowledged and tracked; the engineering execution plan prioritizes uplifting data fidelity in WS-G.

## Open Questions / Blockers

- Define fixture sources for compatibility-oriented contract tests.
- Decide the long-term deployment default for the OHLCV worker: in-process sidecar for local dev, separate hosted worker, or both.
- **Derivatives data source**: Should we implement live CCXT derivatives fetch (not currently in CCXT provider), or accept derivatives as a lower-priority seeded family?
- **Onchain holder/trader data**: No affordable on-chain data provider exists for historical holder/trader snapshots. Should these endpoints remain fixture-only until a cost-effective source is found?
- **Treasury live ingestion**: Is there a real-world use case that requires live Strategy/Spot ETF or El Salvador BTC disclosures, or is the current 2-entity seeded fixture sufficient for development?
- **Chart history depth**: Should the system prioritize deeper OHLCV backfill (365 days for all coins) vs keeping top-100-first policy and accepting shallow history for most coins?

## Key Gaps

1. **Data fidelity (~55% live coverage after Phase 2)**: Phase 2 complete with DeFiLlama multi-network discovery, CCXT coin enrichment, and Subsquid address labels. Remaining gaps are derivatives, treasury, onchain analytics, and chart history.
2. **Derivatives are 100% fixture**: 3 hardcoded tickers, 2 exchanges, data frozen at 2026-03-20. No live CCXT derivatives fetch exists.
3. **Exchange history depth is still bounded even after live ownership uplift**: `/exchanges/{id}/tickers` is now live-backed and `/exchanges/{id}/volume_chart*` accumulates from live ticker refreshes, but long-range history remains limited to retained snapshot coverage rather than deep backfilled venue history.
4. **Onchain holders/traders are fake**: `top_holders`, `top_traders`, `holders_chart` return fixture data for USDC only; all other tokens return empty arrays.
5. **Chart history is synthetic**: All `/coins/*/market_chart`, `/ohlc`, `/ohlc/range` serve seeded 7-day synthetic candles. Real OHLCV accumulates after boot but top-100-first policy means most coins never get real candles.
6. **Treasury is static**: 2 entities, 6 transactions, fixed holdings. No live disclosure ingestion.
7. **Platform-and-catalog-discovery is not sealed yet**: broader global breadth and remaining search relevance uplift still need to land and validate.
8. **Historical chart and OHLC** now has canonical persistence, but longer-horizon policy and hosted-worker operations remain open.
9. **Removed NFT rows** remain intentionally unactioned in the parity matrix and are excluded from the active parity target.

## Known Data-Fidelity Follow-ups

- `/simple/*` and `/coins/markets`: live from CCXT snapshots — data quality is good for supported coins/exchanges.
- `/exchange_rates`: live from currency-api (fiat) and DB snapshot (BTC/ETH) — data quality is good.
- `/coins/{id}`: market_data is live from snapshots; description/links now enriched from CCXT; community/developer remain seeded/null.
- `/coins/{id}/market_chart`, `/ohlc`, `/ohlc/range`, `/history`: backed by seeded 7-day synthetic candles; real OHLCV accumulates post-boot but top-100-first means most coins stay synthetic.
- `/exchanges/{id}/tickers`: live CCXT ticker ingestion now persists venue rows into `coinTickers`; remaining divergence is mainly depth/trust approximation rather than seeded ownership.
- `/exchanges/{id}/volume_chart*`: accumulated from live ticker refresh cycles into `exchangeVolumePoints`; recent windows are live-backed, but historical breadth is still bounded to retained runtime snapshots rather than deep venue-native archives.
- `/derivatives/*`: fully seeded fixture — 3 tickers, 2 exchanges, frozen at 2026-03-20. No CCXT derivatives fetch exists.
- `/public_treasury/*`: 100% seeded fixture (2 entities, 6 transactions). All responses include `meta.fixture: true`. USD values derived from live snapshots.
- `/onchain/networks/*/pools`: now live from DeFiLlama multi-network discovery (ETH, Solana, Avalanche, Fantom); pools are dynamically discovered and enriched with live price/volume/reserve data.
- `/onchain/networks/*/tokens/*`: now live from DeFiLlama with price and decimals enrichment for ETH tokens.
- `/onchain/*/top_holders`, `/onchain/*/top_traders`, `/onchain/*/holders_chart`: fixture only (USDC on ETH, fake addresses). All other tokens return empty arrays.
- `/onchain/pool OHLCV` (fallback): 6 synthetic candles when Subsquid returns nothing.
- `/onchain/pool trades` (fallback): 6 synthetic trades when Subsquid returns nothing; now includes address labels for known DEX routers and pool addresses.
- `/asset_platforms`: now live-backed via canonical CCXT-discovered platform rows.
- `/coins/list/new`: now uses canonical discovery `activated_at` ordering from CCXT-backed catalog sync.
- `/search`: family-grouped output, blank-query rejection, and per-family result bounds are covered; exact-match relevance uplift remains pending.
- The Graph provider was removed in 08e4b39 — Subsquid is now the sole live-trade provider for onchain pool trades.

Live data coverage increased from ~30% to ~55%.

## Update Rules

- Update this file whenever implementation status changes.
- Update this file whenever current priorities or release focus changes.
- Keep statuses factual; do not mark work `done` without code and verification.
