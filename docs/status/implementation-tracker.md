# OpenGecko Implementation Tracker

## Purpose

This file tracks execution progress from the current repository state toward the target product defined in:

- `docs/plans/2026-03-20-opengecko-coingecko-compatible-api-prd.md`
- `docs/plans/2026-03-20-opengecko-endpoint-parity-matrix.md`

Use this tracker for current status, active priorities, completed milestones, and open blockers.

## Status Legend

- `not started`
- `in progress`
- `blocked`
- `partial`
- `done`
- `removed`

## Current Delivery Target

- Current release focus: `R4`
- Current architecture direction: `Bun + TypeScript + Fastify + Zod + SQLite + Drizzle + better-sqlite3 + SQLite FTS5 + CCXT + Vitest`
- Current repository state: `the SQLite-first scaffold, expanded schema, CCXT provider abstraction, complete R0 general/simple endpoints, complete R1 core coin endpoints, complete R2 exchange/derivatives endpoints, the complete seeded R3 public treasury family, and the first seeded onchain catalog endpoints are implemented with passing validation`

## Current Priorities

1. Make hot market endpoints fresh by default via boot-time refresh and continuous internal snapshot updates.
2. Expand the onchain DEX family beyond the initial seeded network and DEX catalogs.
3. Broaden repository-layer and fixture coverage across treasury, onchain, and remaining seeded data-fidelity edge cases.
4. Replace seeded ticker and history slices with CCXT-backed refresh and backfill paths where practical.

## Workstream Status

| Strategic workstream | Operational scope | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-A Compatibility fidelity | Parameter precedence, error shapes, serializers, divergence tracking | partial | R0, R1, R2, and R3 endpoint families are implemented with passing validation; the remaining compatibility work is concentrated in the expanding R4 onchain surface |
| WS-B Live market ingestion and freshness | CCXT provider abstraction, snapshot refresh, stale-data policy, fresh-by-default reads | partial | CCXT-backed market refresh exists, stale-snapshot handling is deterministic, and seed-vs-live snapshot ownership is encoded in a shared service; boot-time refresh and continuous fresh-by-default guarantees still need hardening |
| WS-C Historical chart and OHLC semantics | Chart, range, OHLC, and future onchain OHLCV behavior | partial | Seeded chart and OHLC routes exist with initial granularity and downsampling helpers, but retention, backfill, and onchain OHLCV policy remain open |
| WS-D Canonical entity resolution | Coin, platform, contract, venue, treasury, network, and DEX identity mapping | partial | Seeded registries cover coins, platforms, exchanges, derivatives venues, treasury entities, onchain networks, and DEX catalogs, but live-ingestion and broader onchain identity expansion are still ahead |
| WS-E Contract testing and fixtures | Endpoint fixtures, invalid-parameter coverage, repository/service-layer assertions | partial | Fixture-backed, invalid-parameter, repository-level, stale-data, and chart-semantic tests are in place; broader treasury/onchain and data-fidelity fixture coverage is still missing |
| WS-F Jobs, operations, and observability | Refresh scheduling, search rebuilds, job failure handling, lag visibility | partial | Market refresh and search rebuild jobs exist, but scheduling guarantees, degraded-mode behavior, and observability still need to be locked for fresh-by-default operation |

## Endpoint Family Progress

| Family | Target phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/ping` | R0 | done | CoinGecko-style ping response implemented and tested |
| `/simple/*` | R0 | done | `/simple/supported_vs_currencies`, `/simple/price`, `/simple/token_price/{id}`, and `/exchange_rates` are implemented and tested |
| `/asset_platforms` | R0 | done | Seeded platform registry route implemented and tested |
| `/token_lists/{asset_platform_id}/all.json` | R1 | done | Seeded token-list endpoint implemented and tested for Ethereum |
| `/search` | R0 | done | FTS5-backed grouped search route implemented and tested |
| `/global` | R0 | done | Aggregate market snapshot route implemented and tested |
| `/coins/list` | R0 | done | Seeded coin registry route implemented and tested |
| Core coin market endpoints | R1 | done | `/coins/markets`, `/coins/{id}`, history, chart, OHLC, categories, token lists, and contract-address chart/detail routes are implemented and validated with seeded compatibility coverage, including category filters/details, category ordering, richer history payloads, and interval-aware chart semantics |
| Exchanges / derivatives | R2 | done | `/exchanges/list`, `/exchanges`, `/exchanges/{id}`, `/exchanges/{id}/tickers`, `/exchanges/{id}/volume_chart`, `/derivatives/exchanges/list`, `/derivatives/exchanges`, and `/derivatives` are implemented and validated with seeded compatibility coverage, including exchange status filtering, dex pair formatting, ticker depth toggles, derivatives venue ordering, and seeded contract-level derivatives rows |
| NFTs | removed | removed | removed from the active roadmap |
| Public treasury | R3 | done | `/entities/list`, grouped `/:entity/public_treasury/:coin_id`, `/public_treasury/{entity_id}`, `/public_treasury/{entity_id}/{coin_id}/holding_chart`, and `/public_treasury/{entity_id}/transaction_history` are implemented from seeded curated holdings and transaction data |
| Onchain DEX | R4 | partial | `/onchain/networks` and `/onchain/networks/{network}/dexes` are implemented from seeded network and DEX catalog data |

## Active Decisions

- Use SQLite for MVP and local-first self-hosting.
- Use Bun as the default package manager.
- Prefer the smallest practical dependency set.
- Use CCXT first for exchange and market integrations; only add custom exchange support when required data is missing.
- Use `binance`, `coinbase`, and `kraken` as the initial live CCXT exchange set.
- Use a default market refresh cadence of `60s`, a search rebuild cadence of `900s`, and a live freshness threshold of `300s`.
- Treat fresh-by-default market responses as a central product value; REST reads should come from continuously updated internal snapshots.
- Keep the codebase as a modular monolith before considering service splits.
- Prioritize HTTP contract compatibility before data fidelity.
- Track rollout by endpoint family and release phase.

## Open Questions / Blockers

- Define fixture sources for compatibility-oriented contract tests.
- Decide the default runtime model for fresh-by-default market ingestion: in-process scheduler, separate worker, or both.

## Known Data-Fidelity Follow-ups After Treasury/Onchain Kickoff

- `/coins/{id}` and `/coins/{id}/history` now satisfy the intended R1 contract shape, but their values still come from the current seeded market/history slices rather than live/backfilled sources.
- `/coins/*/market_chart*` and `/ohlc` now support interval-aware semantics, but the underlying series still comes from the current seeded historical window.
- `/coins/categories*`, contract-address variants, and `/token_lists/{asset_platform_id}/all.json` are contract-complete for the current seed set, but broader taxonomy/platform coverage still depends on larger catalogs.
- `/exchanges*` currently uses a small seeded exchange registry, seeded ticker rows, and seeded BTC volume history rather than live exchange ingestion.
- `/derivatives*` now satisfies the intended R2 contract surface, but it is backed by a small seeded derivatives venue and contract set rather than live venue ingestion.
- `/public_treasury*` now exposes holding-chart and transaction-history routes, but it still uses a tiny seeded disclosure/transaction set and reconstructed daily value series rather than a broad curated ledger.
- `/onchain/*` currently uses a small seeded network/DEX catalog and does not yet include pools, token detail, trades, or OHLCV.

## Update Rules

- Update this file whenever implementation status changes.
- Update this file whenever current priorities or release focus changes.
- Keep statuses factual; do not mark work `done` without code and verification.
