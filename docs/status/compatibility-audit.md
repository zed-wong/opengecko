# Compatibility Audit

## Summary

- Matrix endpoints audited: 83 table entries (76 active non-summary endpoints plus 7 NFT endpoints retained as removed-roadmap context).
- Implemented: 76
- Not started: 7
- Status labels: `implemented`, `partial`, `stub`, `not_started`.
- Active non-NFT parity: 76 / 76 matrix endpoints outside the removed NFT family are route-registered.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This audit measures endpoint-surface and response-shape coverage, not current runtime stability. As of `2026-03-29`, the repository still has open Vitest regressions in several core parity-sensitive flows, so `implemented` here should be read as "route exists with audited contract intent", not "release-ready and fully green".

## Coverage & Evidence

- Route inventory taken from `src/modules/*.ts` registration points.
- Response-shape evidence comes from `tests/app.test.ts`, `tests/compare-coingecko.test.ts`, and `tests/fixtures/contract-fixtures.json`.
- Invalid-parameter and envelope evidence comes from `tests/invalid-params.test.ts` plus shared `HttpError` handling in `src/http/errors.ts`.
- NFT rows remain `not_started` because the parity matrix explicitly marks that family as removed from the active roadmap.
- Current release confidence should be read together with `docs/status/implementation-tracker.md`, which tracks the fact that the main Vitest suite is not currently green.

## Per-family field compatibility notes

### Simple + General

- Faithful fields: `gecko_says`, simple quote maps, supported currency arrays, asset platform identity fields, exchange-rate `data` payloads, `search` groups, `global.data` aggregates, token-list standard fields.
- Stubbed/approximate areas: search ranking/trending heuristics and global/defi aggregates remain deterministic local approximations rather than full CoinGecko telemetry.

### Coins + Contracts + Categories

- Faithful fields: market rows, rich coin detail shape, historical/chart/ohlc arrays, contract-address detail/chart parity, category list/leaderboard fields, supply-series envelopes, mover/list-new envelopes.
- Divergences: ranking universe, some market-derived values, and ticker trust/depth semantics are simplified versus CoinGecko.

### Exchanges + Derivatives

- Faithful fields: exchange registry/detail rows, ticker envelopes, derivatives venue summary/detail rows, derivatives contract rows, volume chart tuple shapes.
- Divergences: trust score, some venue metadata, and depth/spread fidelity remain approximated or fixture-backed.

### Public Treasury

- Faithful fields: entity list rows, grouped treasury summaries, entity profile holdings, holding chart arrays, transaction history rows.
- Divergences: finance-derived metrics come from curated seed/live hybrid data rather than full disclosure ingestion.

### Onchain DEX

- Faithful fields: JSON:API `data`/`included`/`meta` envelopes for networks, dexes, pools, tokens, simple token price, trades, OHLCV, categories, megafilter, and ranking/search feeds.
- Divergences: live provider coverage is strongest on Ethereum; several endpoints fall back to seeded or fixture-backed data when live discovery/SQD data is unavailable.
