# Core API Worker

NOTE: Startup and cleanup are handled by `worker-base`. This skill defines the work procedure.

## When to Use This Skill

Use for features involving: foundation fixes (chart timestamps, test failures), chain/ID resolution, historical durability (OHLCV gap repair, retention), exchange live-fidelity, snapshot-parity data-quality fixes, compatibility hardening, and any non-onchain endpoint work.

## Required Skills

None.

## Work Procedure

1. Read `mission.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the assigned feature, and all assigned assertions in `validation-contract.md`.
2. If the feature is part of snapshot-parity work, also read `.factory/library/data-quality-parity.md` and inspect the relevant stored diff/report artifacts or canonical request manifest before changing code.
3. Inspect the relevant source files before making changes. Understand existing patterns.
4. Write failing tests first for the exact behavior you are implementing. Cover both happy-path and error cases. **Exception:** If an existing test already covers the exact failure scenario for a narrowly scoped bug fix, you may rely on that existing test instead of writing a new one. Note this in your handoff.
5. Implement the changes to make tests pass. Follow existing code patterns (Fastify routes, Drizzle queries, Zod validation).
6. Run the targeted tests until they pass.
7. If the manifest-wide baseline test command fails only on issues already listed in `AGENTS.md` as pre-existing, continue with scoped work; record that baseline failure in the handoff.
8. If the feature changes an HTTP contract or route behavior, start the local API (`PORT=3102 HOST=127.0.0.1 DATABASE_URL=:memory: CCXT_EXCHANGES='' LOG_LEVEL=error bun run src/server.ts`) and manually verify at least one valid request plus one invalid/error-path request with curl. Kill the server after. **Note:** Use `DATABASE_URL=:memory:` to avoid SQLite lock conflicts with any running dev server. For snapshot-parity features, prefer the canonical requests from the stored snapshot corpus and note which replay findings improved. If the feature is internal-only helper/runtime/test work with no HTTP-surface change, you may skip curl verification and rely on targeted tests instead; explicitly say so in the handoff.
9. Run `bun run typecheck` before finishing. If your changes affect shared modules, run the broader test suite too.
10. **CRITICAL: Before committing, run `git diff --cached --stat` and verify ONLY your feature files are staged.** If you see unrelated files (especially dirty working-tree files listed in `AGENTS.md`), unstage them with `git reset HEAD <file>`. Never commit unrelated working-tree changes.
11. If your feature needs proof in a large shared file that already has unrelated working-tree hunks and you cannot isolate hunks non-interactively, do not stage the whole shared file. Prefer one of these exec-safe options instead: (a) add a new focused test/file, (b) restore malformed drift in the shared file without staging it, or (c) return to orchestrator for a revised plan. Do not commit unrelated shared-file hunks just because `git add --patch` is unavailable.
12. In the handoff, record exact endpoints, parameters, responses, and replay/diff artifacts used in verification when applicable.

Mission note: If a feature changes route fidelity classification or runtime provenance, update `docs/status/implementation-tracker.md` and `docs/plans/2026-03-29-data-fidelity-uplift-plan.md` in the same change set so docs and runtime tell the same story.

## Example Handoff

```json
{
  "salientSummary": "Fixed 4 pre-existing test failures caused by timestamp drift in seeded chart data. Made chartPoints population date-relative instead of absolute. Committed existing chain-normalization work. All 343 tests now pass.",
  "whatWasImplemented": "Updated seeded chart point generation to use relative date offsets from test execution time instead of hardcoded absolute timestamps. Bridged the chartPoints table to read from OHLCV candle store when available. Committed the existing platform-id alias resolution in src/lib/platform-id.ts and updated chain-catalog-sync, catalog, assets, and simple modules.",
  "whatWasLeftUndone": "",
  "verification": {
    "commandsRun": [
      {
        "command": "bun run test",
        "exitCode": 0,

      },
      {
        "command": "bun run typecheck",
        "exitCode": 0,
        "observation": "No type errors."
      }

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },

## When to Return to Orchestrator

- The feature requires schema migrations that would break other in-progress features
- Test failures appear to be caused by changes from a different feature (not your own)
- Requirements are ambiguous or contradictory
- External provider integration is needed (use onchain-api-worker for DeFiLlama/TheGraph)
