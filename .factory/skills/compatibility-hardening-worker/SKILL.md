# Compatibility Hardening Worker

NOTE: Startup and cleanup are handled by `worker-base`. This skill defines the work procedure.

## When to Use This Skill

Use for compatibility audit features, fidelity-accounting and tracker updates, snapshot capture/replay infrastructure, normalization rules, divergence registries, serializer fixture creation, parity report generation, and any feature focused on cross-endpoint consistency rather than new functionality.

## Required Skills

None.

## Work Procedure

1. Read `mission.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the assigned feature, and all assigned assertions in `validation-contract.md`.
2. Read the endpoint parity matrix at `docs/plans/2026-03-20-opengecko-endpoint-parity-matrix.md` to understand the full endpoint surface.
3. Read existing comparison coverage in `tests/invalid-params.test.ts`, `tests/compare-coingecko.test.ts`, and any mission-specific snapshot/replay tests or rules files already present.
4. If the feature touches snapshot parity infrastructure, read `.factory/library/data-quality-parity.md` plus any checked-in capture manifest, normalization ruleset, or divergence registry before editing.
5. Write failing tests first for the exact behavior you are adding: capture manifest accounting, offline replay, classification, report schema, divergence labeling, or regression gate behavior.
6. For snapshot/replay features: prove the workflow can run from stored local artifacts without repeated upstream calls; preserve raw payloads and request-identifying metadata/evidence links.
7. For report features: emit machine-readable artifacts with stable ordering and enough ownership/evidence context to route fixes. Do not generate docs in `docs/status/` unless the assigned feature explicitly asks for it; when it does, keep route-compatibility and live-fidelity classifications explicit and non-contradictory.
8. Run `bun run test` and `bun run typecheck`. If the baseline test suite fails only on issues already listed in mission `AGENTS.md` as pre-existing, continue with scoped work and record the baseline failure exactly in the handoff.
9. If the feature changes replay/report behavior, start the validation API on port 3102 and manually verify at least one canonical replay/report flow against stored artifacts. If the feature is purely internal test/rules wiring, explain why curl verification was not needed.
10. In the handoff, list every manifest entry, endpoint family, or report artifact covered and the specific validation checks added.

Mission note: For fixture-honesty or fidelity-accounting features, docs-only edits are insufficient when the validation contract expects runtime behavior. Add machine-checkable provenance or explicit empty/synthetic semantics at the HTTP boundary when the assigned assertions require it.

## Example Handoff

```json
{
  "salientSummary": "Expanded invalid-parameter test coverage to all 6 endpoint families. Added 24 new test cases covering pagination, ordering, boolean, and precision parameter validation. Created per-family compatibility report in docs/status/.",
  "whatWasImplemented": "Added invalid-param tests for treasury family (3 new cases), expanded onchain family coverage (6 new cases), added pagination uniformity tests across all paginated endpoints. Created docs/status/compatibility-audit.md with per-endpoint status for all 76 matrix endpoints.",
  "whatWasLeftUndone": "",
  "verification": {
    "commandsRun": [
      {
        "command": "bun run test",
        "exitCode": 0,

      },
      {
        "command": "bun run typecheck",
        "exitCode": 0,
        "observation": "No type errors."
      }
    ],
    "interactiveChecks": [
      {
        "action": "Curled GET /coins/markets?page=0 and GET /exchanges?page=-1",
        "observed": "Both return 400 with consistent {error: 'invalid_parameter'} envelope."
      },
      {
        "action": "Curled GET /coins/not-a-coin and GET /exchanges/not-an-exchange",
        "observed": "Both return 404 with consistent {error: 'not_found'} envelope."

            "verifies": "Uniform 400 response for page=0, page=-1, page=abc across coins, exchanges, onchain, derivatives."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },

}

## When to Return to Orchestrator

- An endpoint has a structural incompatibility that requires architectural changes beyond test/fixture work
- The parity matrix contains endpoints not yet registered as routes (implementation gap, not hardening gap)
- Existing test infrastructure cannot express the required assertion pattern
