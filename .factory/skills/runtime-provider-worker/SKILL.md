# Runtime Provider Worker

NOTE: Startup and cleanup are handled by `worker-base`. This skill defines the WORK PROCEDURE.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for features that change provider/runtime coordination or runtime-state visibility, including:
- startup, bind, shutdown, and restart lifecycle hardening
- provider pooling follow-through and bounded concurrency
- circuit-breaker or fail-fast provider protection
- degraded boot and stale-live fallback coordination
- health, readiness, and diagnostics surfaces tied to runtime state

## Required Skills

None.

## Work Procedure

1. Read `mission.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `validation-contract.md`, the assigned feature, and the relevant `.factory/library/` notes before changing anything.
2. Identify the exact externally observable behaviors the feature owns from `fulfills`. Write failing characterization or regression tests first for those behaviors and any closely coupled runtime lifecycle paths. If the bug appears only after `listen()` or only on a live server entrypoint, first reproduce it manually on the declared port so you can target the right listener-path behavior before adding the regression test.
3. Trace the runtime path end to end before editing:
   - `src/app.ts`
   - `src/server.ts`
   - `src/services/market-runtime.ts`
   - `src/services/market-runtime-state.ts`
   - `src/providers/ccxt.ts`
   - any touched diagnostics/health modules
4. For any arithmetic you introduce or change in provider/runtime code, use `bignumber.js` rather than raw JavaScript number math. Keep precision-sensitive calculations in `BigNumber` form until persistence or API serialization requires primitives.
5. Prefer service-layer fixes over route-local patches. Keep provider failure control, concurrency, and fallback policy centralized.
6. Preserve CoinGecko contracts. Runtime hardening may add health/diagnostic surfaces, but it must not silently change `/ping`, `/simple/price`, or `/coins/markets` payload semantics.
7. If the feature exposes runtime state externally, ensure the state is machine-readable and aligned with actual hot-endpoint behavior; do not expose vague booleans without cause/source context.
8. If bootstrap-only persisted rows become an intended runtime source, implement that through a distinct runtime mode or equally first-class access-policy signal rather than by piggybacking on validation-only overrides. Update characterization tests for diagnostics, `/simple/price`, `/simple/token_price`, `/coins/markets`, and `/coins/{id}` together so they all agree on the new mode.
9. Run targeted tests covering startup/shutdown, provider coordination, stale/degraded behavior, and the touched health/diagnostics surfaces.
10. Run `bun run typecheck` before finishing.
11. Manually verify with live probes:
   - startup or restart sequence on the declared mission port
   - `/ping`
   - the affected hot endpoint(s)
   - health/diagnostics endpoints if touched
12. If validation finds a pre-existing unrelated repo failure, record it exactly and continue with scoped verification. If you need a new contract decision, return to the orchestrator instead of guessing.

Mission note: If a feature touches readiness probes, reconcile README/service-manifest/testing guidance with the actual runtime probe contract in the same change set. Do not leave `/health` documentation diverged from the implemented probe surface.

## Example Handoff

```json
{
  "salientSummary": "Added readiness/degraded diagnostics and bounded provider failure handling without changing the public ping contract. Verified startup now reports machine-readable runtime status and hot endpoints remain safe during simulated upstream failure and recovery.",
  "whatWasImplemented": "Wrote failing runtime and diagnostics tests first, then added centralized provider failure state plus runtime-status reporting wired to market-runtime state. Updated startup/shutdown flow so restart no longer leaks prior degraded flags, and aligned diagnostics fields with the actual stale-live fallback behavior seen by /simple/price and /coins/markets.",

## When to Return to Orchestrator

- The feature needs a new public runtime-status contract that is not covered by the mission validation contract.
- A provider-control change would require external infrastructure or credentials not already approved.
- You cannot make runtime-state evidence align with endpoint behavior without changing the mission scope.
